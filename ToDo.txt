Things to do for the next version:

High level tasks:
Able to share xp / rested levels. - how?  Why?
Done - create instance run timers.
Done - Created when zoning in
Done - Starts with first damage done in the instance
Done - ends when all the listed bosses are killed.

- http://www.wowwiki.com/API_COMBAT_LOG_EVENT
- COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED
- event:  UNIT_DIED


- an instance is cancelled / incomplete if a kill out side the instance happens before the boss is killed.
- cancelled or incomplete instances are not saved
- recording is reset when all the bosses are killed, or a new instance is entered

save history of the last 100 runs of an instance
- per player.
	- Start time is key
	-
- and per account - compare how?

keep the names of all the party/raid members at the last boss.
- only per player
----- Not worth the time with new LFD system, no real way to regroup

====
create user timers

====
General clean up

======================
tasks to accomplish:

========
5 instances per hour
Can show the number of instances started in the last hour.
- Use the instance bar
- Show after instance info fades
- Fade when reaches 0
- show text, and show 5 as 100%
----- not worth the time

========
local DefaultMessages = { GetChatWindowMessages(DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:GetID()) };
Use the above to determine if rep messages are shown
-- if they are, suppress individual messages for combat

AddChatWindowMessages(index, "messagegroup")
RemoveChatWindowMessages(index, "messagegroup")
"COMBAT_FACTION_CHANGE" is the messagegroup
Use the above to possibly supress rep messages in an instance and re-enable them later.
event?: CHANNEL_FLAGS_UPDATED  -- nope


=========
/chatlog
/combatlog

=========
Dungeon start message should show best, average, and longest time message
Time warnings....
50% till best
when passing best
when passing average
when passing worse

=========
Need a better way to determine the start of an instance
event: UNIT_COMBAT
---   Need to change this to watching the combatlog


=========
Taxi Timer - By Request
-- Events: TAXIMAP_OPENED, TAXIMAP_CLOSED

=========
Instance List window 
(Yeah! First actual gui element other than the freaking bars)
Show a window listing instances as expandable headers (collapsed by default)
Mousing over the header will show stats for a run
Expanding the header will show a list of all the runs (by date - and run time)
each item will have a check box

A delete button at the bottom of the window will be enabled once an instance is checked for deletion.

Window header can show the total number of runs for this character, and the time spent in dungeons.

(+) Halls of Reflection (5 runs)     | Best Time , ave time (sd), longest time
===========
(-) Halls of Reflection - Heroic (5 runs) | Best Time, ave time (sd), longest time

====== 
Seems that the LFG form is the one to look at here for how it is done. It seems to the about the closest 
to what is happening.  Has collapsed headers and checked boxes.
